Dear User interester in such sorter, 

I appreciate you giving my first ever small project a look. I would love feedback on anything technical as I'm not too inclined in making apps rather than just building code at the moment. 
If there's anywhere that looks like I messed up, leaked data or anything please let me know. 
I plan to try and slowly update this depending on plan of work, but also let me know if you would like anything added. 


DIRECTIONS IF NECESSARY: 
- Opening the .exe will open a browse window to choose your .csv file.
- Choose what you want to sort it by from the options.
- Files will be sorted and saved into downloads.
